This is the code from a CS Crew workshop I led to teach people some fun graphics programming with Processing. Processing is an IDE that injects a bunch of functions and variables into global python scope that make graphics/game dev extremely easy.

You can download it at https://processing.org/ . It defaults to java mode, so you'll have to look up how to add Python mode.

The code in this repository is made to be followed along with.  Make sure you have each file working before you move to the next one.
